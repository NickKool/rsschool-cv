## About me

Now I work as a sales manager. Where I learned to work with different people and multitask. A couple of years ago I took design courses. But at that time in my life I put it aside. Now I want to combine the skills I once acquired in web design and learn to create more than design. I want to be able to give life to these sites, applications and monitor and support their performance.
